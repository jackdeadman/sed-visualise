# SED (Sound Event Detection) Visualisation
## What is this?
This is a tool which allows researchers to easily demonstrate the results of their SED systems. It can also be easily be used locally, for quickly seeing development results.

## Installation
- clone the repo
- cd to server
- run python app.py (install dependencies)
- go to http://localhost:5000

- Once this page loads, click "or use an example file", then verify the baseline system works.
- Now to add your own classifiers simply add a file in /server/sed_systems. Use the baseline.py file in that folder as a reference.
